# CircumVault
CircumVault goes straight through "Unidentified developer" by extracting the app's core executable from the app's Info.plist and runs the executable using terminal. <br />
It is just a simple Automator workflow. <br />
Oh yeah, Node.js is a dependency. https://nodejs.org/ <br />
Here's how to install it: <br />
Install node.js <br />
`git clone https://github.com/hieyou1/circumvaultgit.git` <br />
`cd circumvaultgit` <br />
`./INSTALL` <br />
You're welcome. Yes, it's that easy. No, we are not fooling you. <br />
You also need full read, write and execute access to your own home directory. But, everyone should have that already. <br />
Nothing needs to be run with `sudo`. We aren't changing any files other than the ones in your own home directory, and obviously the ones in the git folder. <br />
