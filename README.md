# CircumVault
CircumVault goes straight through "Unidentified developer" by extracting the app's core executable from the app's Info.plist and runs the executable using terminal. 
It is just a simple Automator workflow.
Oh yeah, Node.js is a dependency. https://nodejs.org/
Here's how to install it:
Install node.js then
`git clone https://github.com/hieyou1/circumvaultgit.git` then
`cd circumvaultgit` then
`./INSTALL`
You're welcome. Yes, it's that easy. No, we are not fooling you.
You also need full read, write and execute access to your own home directory. But, everyone should have that already.
Nothing needs to be run with `sudo`. We aren't changing any files other than the ones in your own home directory.
